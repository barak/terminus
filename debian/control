Description: Drop-down or in-window terminal for X11 and Wayland
 This is a new-generation (post-Guake) terminal for X11 and Wayland,
 which features a hot-key Quake-console-like drop-down mode.  Other
 features include a scroll-back buffer, tabs, split screen both
 horizontal and vertical, and the usual compatibility features.
