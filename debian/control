Description: A new terminal for X11 and Wayland both for classic,
 in-window terminal, and Guake-like (hot-key drop-down mode)
 terminal. It also allows to split the window both in horizontal
 and vertical, like Terminator, all in one program. Other features
 include a scroll-back buffer, tabs, and the usual compatibility
 features.
